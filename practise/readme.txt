Find a foder in given folder and if the folder exist, find the filei inside that folder if the file exist then count the word given by user is available inside
that file,and print the count of that word.





CardDeckProblem.c
You are given a deck containing N cards.  While holding the deck facedown:

1. Deal all the cards facedown onto a table into Y piles like you would if you were playing with a group of people (i.e. card 1 to P1, card 2 to P2, ..., card Y to PY, card Y + 1 to P1, etc).
2. Combine all the piles into a deck by placing P1 onto P2, then P1+P2 onto P3, and so on. This is a round.
3. Pick up the deck from the table and repeat steps 1-2 until the deck is in the original order.
4. For each round, vary the pile count according to a repeating pattern. Start with 3 piles, then 4, then 5, then loop back to 3, then 4 and so on.
	
Write a program to determine how many rounds it will take to put a deck back into the original order.  This will involve creating a data structure to represent the order of the cards. Do not use an array. This program should be written in C only. It should take a number of cards in the deck as a command line argument and write the result to stdout.  Please ensure the program compiles and runs correctly (no pseudo-code).  This isn't a trick question; it should be fairly straightforward.

Bonus: Output how many rounds should be completed before the deck is adequately shuffled from the original deck for a person who is casually playing a game with cards. Provide your methodology in a comment block.
